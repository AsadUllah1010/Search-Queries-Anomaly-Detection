# Search-Queries-Anomaly-Detection
Search Queries Anomaly Detection means identifying queries that are outliers according to their performance metrics. It is valuable for businesses to spot potential issues or opportunities, such as unexpectedly high or low CTRs.
# Introduction
Search Queries Anomaly Detection is a technique to identify unusual or unexpected patterns in search query data. Below is the process we can follow for the task of Search Queries Anomaly Detection:
1. Gather historical search query data from the source, such as a search engine or a website’s search functionality.
2. Conduct an initial analysis to understand the distribution of search queries, their frequency, and any noticeable patterns or trends.
3. Create relevant features or attributes from the search query data that can aid in anomaly detection.
4. Choose an appropriate anomaly detection algorithm. Common methods include statistical approaches like Z-score analysis and machine learning algorithms like Isolation Forests or One-Class SVM.
5. Train the selected model on the prepared data.
6. Apply the trained model to the search query data to identify anomalies or outliers.
# Features
1. Top Queries: The actual search terms used by users.
2. Clicks: The number of times users clicked on the website after using the query.
3. Impressions: The number of times the website appeared in search results for the query.
4. CTR (Click Through Rate): The ratio of clicks to impressions, indicating the effectiveness of the query in leading users to the website.
5. Position: The average ranking of the website in search results for the query.
# Usage
Jupyter Notebook
# Conclusion
In this correlation matrix:
1. Clicks and Impressions are positively correlated, meaning more Impressions tend to lead to more Clicks.
2. Clicks and CTR have a weak positive correlation, implying that more Clicks might slightly increase the Click-Through Rate.
3. Clicks and Position are weakly negatively correlated, suggesting that higher ad or page Positions may result in fewer Clicks.
4. Impressions and CTR are negatively correlated, indicating that higher Impressions tend to result in a lower Click-Through Rate.
5. Impressions and Position are positively correlated, indicating that ads or pages in higher Positions receive more Impressions.
6. CTR and Position have a strong negative correlation, meaning that higher Positions result in lower Click-Through Rates.

The anomalies in our search query data are not just outliers. They are indicators of potential areas for growth, optimization, and strategic focus. These anomalies are reflecting emerging trends or areas of growing interest. Staying responsive to these trends will help in maintaining and growing the website’s relevance and user engagement. So, Search Queries Anomaly Detection means identifying queries that are outliers according to their performance metrics. It is valuable for businesses to spot potential issues or opportunities, such as unexpectedly high or low CTRs.
